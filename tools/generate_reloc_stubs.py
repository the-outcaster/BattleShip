generate_reloc_stubs.py — Emit include/reloc_data.h as a complete
#define-only mirror of tools/reloc_data_symbols.us.txt.

The decomp references ~3900 `ll*` linker symbols across src/. On N64 the
MIPS linker turns each one into an absolute address constant via
`symbols/reloc_data_symbols.us.txt` (vendored here as
tools/reloc_data_symbols.us.txt). On PC we cannot use a MIPS linker, but
the decomp uses many of these symbols as file-scope struct-literal
initialisers — which C11 only accepts if they are **constant
expressions**, not `extern` variables. So we emit a `#define`-only
header whose entries are the real numeric values from the symbols table.

The header includes **every** symbol in the vendored table, not just the
subset that src/ currently references. That matters because downstream
tools (tools/generate_yamls.py) parse reloc_data.h to turn `ll*FileID`
symbols into human-readable archive paths — `DkIcon`, `MasterHandIcon`,
etc. — and the game looks those files up by file_id at runtime even
though the `ll*` symbol names never appear in src/. Filtering to
src/-referenced symbols silently drops entries from the name table and
causes Torch to extract the files under their fallback `file_NNNN`
names, which then don't match `port/resource/RelocFileTable.cpp`.

Any `ll*` identifier that src/ references but that is missing from the
symbols table (e.g. a brand-new symbol added to the decomp sources) is
still emitted, as an `(intptr_t){0}` fallback with a `/* STUBBED */`
comment so it can be grepped and triaged later.

Generates:
    include/reloc_data.h  — `#define <name> (*(intptr_t*)<value>)` per
                            symbol in the table, plus stubs for any
                            extra `ll*` names referenced by src/.

Usage: run from the repo root.
